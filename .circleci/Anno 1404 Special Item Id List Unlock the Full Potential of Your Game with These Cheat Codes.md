## What is the special item id list and how to access it?
  
The special item id list is a list of codes that correspond to every item in Anno 1404. You can use these codes to cheat and get any item you want in the game. To access the special item id list, you need to enable the cheat mode first. Here's how:
  
1. Go to your Anno 1404 installation folder and open the "engine.ini" file with a text editor.
2. Find the line that says "// Properties" and add a new line below it with the following code: `Tools = true`
3. Save and close the file.
4. Launch the game and start a new or load an existing game.
5. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to open the cheat menu.
6. Select "AddItem" from the drop-down list and enter the code of the item you want in the text box.
7. Click "OK" and check your inventory for the item.

You can repeat this process as many times as you want to get more items. However, be careful not to use too many items at once, as this may cause glitches or crashes. Also, note that cheating may reduce your enjoyment of the game and prevent you from earning achievements. Use it at your own risk.
